Since I've Been Loving You
Led Zeppelin

Workin' from seven to eleven every night
It really makes life a drag
I don't think that's right
I've really been the best of fools
I did what I could, yeah
'Cause I love you, baby
How I love you, darling
How I love you, baby
My beloved little girl, little girl
But baby, since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh yeah
