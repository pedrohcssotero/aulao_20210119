Since I've Been Loving You
Led Zeppelin

Workin' from seven to eleven every night
It really makes life a drag
I don't think that's right
I've really been the best of fools
I did what I could, yeah
'Cause I love you, baby
How I love you, darling
How I love you, baby
My beloved little girl, little girl
But baby, since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh yeah

Everybody trying to tell me
That you didn't mean me no good
I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you
Let me tell you I really did the best I could
I've been working from seven to eleven every night
I said it kinda makes my life a drag
Lord, that ain't right, no no
Since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose my worried mind
Watch out

Said I've been crying, yeah
Oh, my tears they fell like rain
Don't you hear, don't you hear them falling
Don't you hear, don't you hear them falling

Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door?
I said you had the nerve to tell me
You didn't want me no more, yeah
I open my front door, hear my back door slam
You know, you must have one of them new fangled
New fangled back door man

I've been working from seven, seven, seven to eleven every night
It kinda makes my life a drag, a drag, drag
Ah, yeah, it makes a drag
Baby, since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose
I'm about to lose, lose my worried mind
Just one more, just one more, oh yeah
Since I've been loving you, I'm about to lose my worried mind
