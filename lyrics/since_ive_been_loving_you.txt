Since I've Been Loving You
Led Zeppelin

Workin' from seven to eleven every night
It really makes life a drag
I don't think that's right
I've really been the best of fools
I did what I could, yeah
'Cause I love you, baby
How I love you, darling
How I love you, baby
My beloved little girl, little girl
But baby, since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh yeah

Everybody trying to tell me
That you didn't mean me no good
I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you
Let me tell you I really did the best I could
I've been working from seven to eleven every night
I said it kinda makes my life a drag
Lord, that ain't right, no no
Since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose my worried mind
Watch out
Said I've been crying, yeah
